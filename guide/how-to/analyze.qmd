Through [`kimmdy-analysis`](/guide/references/cmd_ref.html#analysis), several tools are provided to analyze various aspects of
KIMMDY runs.


## Energy

`kimmdy-analysis energy` sets the usual energy analysis by gmx energy into
the context of KIMMDY, by showing the KIMMDY MD steps next to the energy
plot. An example KIMMDY run of three HAT reactions is shown below.

All energy terms
supported in the GROMACS tool `gmx energy` can be plotted. The lowest plot shows
which KIMMDY MD run is running at a given time. Here, three HAT reactions are
performed, each in between two equilibrium MD simulations.

## Radical Occupancy

`kimmdy-analysis radical_population` analyzes where, and for how long radi-
cals are in the system. The resulting statistic can be visualized in two ways. First,
as values on a three-dimensional snapshot of the system, as shown in below.
For this, a pdb file of the structure is generated, containing the calculated radical
occupancy as its beta value for visualization with established software, like vmd. And
second, as a bar plot of the fractional radical occupancy per atom.
Depending on the number of involved atoms, the structure, or the bar plot might
be more useful.

## Radical Migrations

The `kimmdy-analysis radical_migration` tool can generate visualizations.
Depicting between which atoms HAT reactions occur. The arrows
can be colored according to the number of HAT reactions, or the maximum rate for
the respective transition.

## Reaction Rates

`kimmdy-analysis rates` can generate plots of all available rates entering a kMC step.
By default, KIMMDY generates in the kMC step of every reaction a plot, showing
calculated rates over the course of the latest simulation. This can be turned off in the input yaml.
If in the kMC step a reaction is chosen, the corresponding rates
are highlighted bold and dashed. Each reaction recipe has a string representation,
consisting of the involved atom numbers and symbols for the actions. Bonds breaking
are depicted as bolt. A new bond, and a movement are both represented with an arrow.

## Runtimes

`kimmdy-analysis runtime` analyzes the runtime of kimmdy. Besides showing
the runtime of all tasks performed it can group tasks, and types of tasks together.
The example analyzes the runtime of KIMMDY performing
20 consecutive HAT reactions after an initial homolysis reaction.
As the simulated system is
quite small (the charged_peptide example is used), the MD simulations are comparatively fast.
For bigger systems, the MD runtime will increase, while the time required for HAT
reaction barrier predictions will not, as it only atoms close to a radical are taken into
account. Therefore, the computational overhead of KIMMDY should be negligible
in most use cases.
