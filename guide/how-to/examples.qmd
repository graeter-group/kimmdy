## Further Examples

KIMMDY contains examples generated from our internal test systems.
Those examples don't currently have extensive documentation,
but they can be used as a starting point for your own simulations.

The examples are located in the `examples` directory of the KIMMDY source code
[here](https://github.com/hits-mbm-dev/kimmdy/tree/main/example).

Here are their `kimmdy.yml` files at a glance:


```{python}
#| output: asis
#| echo: false
# list directories in examples
import os
path = '../../example'
dirs = os.listdir(path)
for dir in dirs:
  kimmdy_config = path + '/' + dir + '/kimmdy.yml'
  if os.path.isfile(kimmdy_config):
    header = f"### {dir}\n"
    print(header)
    content = open(kimmdy_config, 'r').read()
    print('```yaml')
    print(content)
    print('```')
```
