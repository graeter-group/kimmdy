; The following Bond dissociation energies (in kj/mol) were calculated with the G4(MP2)-6X procedure
; by Christoph Karfusehr at the Heidelberg Institute for Theoretical Studies.
; Nomenclature for collagen crosslinks is taken from: Obarska-Kosinsk et al. 2021
; Peptide nomenclature: atom_name + one_letter_aminoacid_code.
; Calculations are described in the master thesis of Christoph Karfusehr.
; BDEs within the pyridine core  were not calculated but only set to a large value (500 kj/mol),
; as they are not expected to rupture.

; The bracketed lines are used to assign the following dissociation energies to a residue.
; GROMACS treats all lines with three space separated words as dissociation energies and other lines are ignored.
; e.g. '[gmx]' will be ignored but '[ gmx ]' results in an error.

;;; for GROMACS (averaged or standard values)
;;; this should be before the KIMMDY section because GROMACS parses from the top of the file
