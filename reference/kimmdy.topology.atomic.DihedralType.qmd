`topology.atomic.DihedralType(i, j, k, l, id, id_sym, funct, c0, c1, periodicity, c3=None, c4=None, c5=None)`

Information about one dihedral

A class containing bond information as in the dihedrals section of the topology.
Proper dihedrals have funct 9.
Improper dihedrals have funct 4.

Note that proper dihedrals of type 9 can be defined multiple times, for different
periodicities. This is why would-be parameter c2 is called periodicity and part of
the `id`.

From gromacs topology:
';', 'i', 'j', 'k', 'l', 'funct', 'c0', 'c1', 'periodicity', 'c3', 'c4', 'c5'
Where i,j,k,l are atomtypes
