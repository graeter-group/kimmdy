## Autocompletion

KIMMDY comes with autocompletion and tooltips insight your editor for its configuration file `kimmdy.yml`. 

All you need to do is activate a [yaml-language-server](https://github.com/redhat-developer/yaml-language-server)
in your editor (e.g. [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) via the 
[YAML extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=redhat.vscode-yaml) or 
[Neovim](https://neovim.io/) via [lspconfig](https://github.com/neovim/nvim-lspconfig)).

Activating this is very much recommended, as it prevents many typos and missaligned braces.

::: {.callout-tip appearance="simple"}
This only works, if your config file is called `kimmdy.yml` and the Scheme Store hasn't been disabled
in your editor settings (e.g. `Yaml > Schema Store: Enable`.
:::

## All Options

The following is a list of the options that can be set in the `kimmdy.yml` file.
It includes reactions currently available in KIMMDY as plugins.
Nested options are separated by a `.`.
`*` denotes an arbitrary name for a section.
The key for a section is **bold**.

```{python}
#| output: asis
from kimmdy.plugins import discover_plugins
from kimmdy.schema import get_combined_scheme, flatten_scheme, generate_markdown_table

discover_plugins()
scheme = get_combined_scheme()
flat_scheme = flatten_scheme(scheme)
table = generate_markdown_table(flat_scheme)

print(table)
print(
  ': KIMMDY options  {#tbl-options .striped .hover tbl-colwidths="[25,50,15,15]"}'
)
```
