Default True | bool | True |\n| cwd | Working directory. Default is current working directory | Path |  |\n| name | Used for output folder if `out` is not specified | str | kimmdy |\n| out | Output folder | Path |  |\n| log | Settings for logging |  |  |\n| max_tasks | Maximum number of tasks to run. This is useful when a task in the sequence can dymanically add more tasks. 0 means no limit. | int | 0 |\n| max_hours | Stop KIMMDY after max_hours hours. Set this lower than the limit of your HPC cluster for use with a re-submit jobscript. 0 Means no limit. | int | 0 |\n| kmc | KMC algorithm overwrite. Should be set by the reactions, but can be changed here. | str |  |\n| tau_scale | Scaling parameter for tau in the extrande kmc algorithm. | float | 1.0 |\n| top | Topology file | Path | topol.top |\n| topology | Settings for handling the topology file. |  |  |\n| topology.reactive.include | Explicitly include a moleculetype or list of moleculetypes as a space-separated string. | str |  |\n| topology.reactive.exclude | Explicitly exclude a moleculetype or a list as a space-separated string. For example the lipid moleculetype in a bilayer simulation e.g. `DPPC POPC'` | str |  |\n| gro | Coordinate file | Path | conf.gro |\n| ndx | Gromaxs index file | Path | index.ndx |\n| gromacs_alias | Gromacs alias. e.g. `gmx` or `mpirun gmx_mpi` | str | gmx |\n| gmx_mdrun_flags | Flags passed to gmx mdrun. Default `-maxh 24 -dlb yes` | str | -maxh 24 -dlb yes |\n| ff | Force field directory (looks for .ff in cwd if not set) | Path | *.ff |\n| plumed | .dat file containing plumed config | Path |  |\n| tpr | .tpr file of a finished simulation for starting directly with a reaction | Path |  |\n| trr | .trr file of a finished simulation for starting directly with a reaction | Path |  |\n| mds | Settings for MD steps, e.g. mdp files, plumed files, etc. |  |  |\n| mds.\\*.mdp | MDP file for the MD step | Path |  |\n| mds.\\*.use_plumed | Whether plumed should be used for this run or not | bool | False |\n| changer | Settings for applying a reaction recipe |  |  |\n| changer.coordinates.md | MD step from the 'mds' section that is used for relaxation MDs | str |  |\n| changer.coordinates.slow_growth | Whether the chosen MD step is a slow growth/free-energy simulation | bool | False |\n| changer.topology.parameterization | Parameterization scheme that is used on the topology file after changes to it | str | basic |\n| sequence | List of tasks. Each task can be a string (the name of the task) or an object with the task name and a multiplicity `mult: <int>` | Sequence |  |\n| reactions | Settings for reactions |  |  |\n| plot_rates | Plot the reaction rates during the reactions step | bool | True |\n| save_recipes | Save recipes as csv during the reactions step | bool | True |\n: KIMMDY options  {#tbl-options .striped .hover tbl-colwidths=\"[25,50,15,15]\"}\n\n\n## Example `kimmdy.yml` Files\n\n```{.yaml filename='kimmdy.yml'}\ndryrun: false\nmax_tasks: 100\nname: 'hat_tf_000'\ngromacs_alias: 'gmx'\ntop: 'Ala_out.top'\ngro: 'npt.gro'\nndx: 'index.ndx'\nmds:\n  equilibrium:\n    mdp: 'md.mdp'\n  relax:\n    mdp: 'md_slow.mdp'\nchanger:\n  coordinates:\n    md: 'relax'      \nreactions:\n  hat_reaction:\n    frequency_factor: 100000000\n    h_cutoff: 3\n    polling_rate: 1\n\nsequence:\n- equilibrium\n- mult: 2\n  tasks:\n  - equilibrium\n  - reactions\n```\n\n",
