## Setup

You need an installation of python (`>= 3.10`) and (possibly PLUMED patched) GROMACS in your
HPC environment.

Example setup:

```bash
srun -t 1400:00 --mem=16000 -n20 --pty /bin/bash
ml EasyBuild
eb ./assets/Python-3.10.8.eb
```

Prepare a bash script `_modules.sh` that loads the required modules and activates
the python environment in which KIMMDY is installed.

Run

```bash
kimmdy --generate-jobscript
```

to generate a file `jobscript.sh` that can be submitted to the HPC cluster.

This commands generates a kimmdy checkpoint and prepares the output folder.
KIMMDY can then be started and re-started from the checkpoint via the jobscript,
which uses

```bash
# -c = continue, same  as --from-latest-checkpoint
kimmdy -c
```
