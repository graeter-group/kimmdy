Default is current working directory | Path |  |\n| name | Used for output folder if `out` is not specified | str | kimmdy |\n| out | Output folder | Path |  |\n| log | Settings for logging |  |  |\n| max_tasks | Maximum number of tasks to run. This is useful when a task in the sequence can dymanically add more tasks. 0 means no limit. | int | 0 |\n| max_hours | Stop KIMMDY after max_hours hours. Set this lower than the limit of your HPC cluster for use with a re-submit jobscript. 0 Means no limit. | int | 0 |\n| kmc | KMC algorithm overwrite. Should be set by the reactions, but can be changed here. | str |  |\n| tau_scale | Scaling parameter for tau in the extrande kmc algorithm. | float | 1.0 |\n| top | Topology file | Path | topol.top |\n| topology | Settings for handling the topology file. |  |  |\n| topology.reactive.include | Explicitly include a moleculetype or list of moleculetypes as a space-separated string. | str |  |\n| topology.reactive.exclude | Explicitly exclude a moleculetype or a list as a space-separated string.

Default `-maxh 24 -dlb yes` | str | -maxh 24 -dlb yes |\n| ff | Force field directory (looks for .ff in cwd if not set) | Path | *.ff |\n| residuetypes | GROMACS rtp file that contains residuetypes. Looks for `aminoacids.rtp` it not set. KIMMDY will first look in the current working directory and then relative to the forecfield directory. | Path |  |\n| radicals | space-separated string of radical atom ids, can be empty | str |  |\n| plumed | .dat file containing plumed config | Path |  |\n| tpr | .tpr file of a finished simulation for starting directly with a reaction | Path |  |\n| trr | .trr file of a finished simulation for starting directly with a reaction | Path |  |\n| restart | Restart from a previous run. |  |  |\n| mds | Settings for MD steps, e.g. mdp files, plumed files, etc. |  |  |\n| mds.\\*.mdp | MDP file for the MD step | Path |  |\n| mds.\\*.use_plumed | Whether plumed should be used for this run or not | bool | False |\n| changer | Settings for applying a reaction recipe |  |  |\n| changer.coordinates.md | MD step from the 'mds' section that is used for relaxation MDs | str |  |\n| changer.coordinates.slow_growth | Whether the chosen MD step is a slow growth/free-energy simulation | bool | False |\n| changer.topology.parameterization | Parameterization scheme that is used on the topology file after changes to it | str | basic |\n| changer.topology.parameterization_kwargs | Keyword argument container for the selected parameterization scheme |  |  |\n| sequence | List of tasks.
