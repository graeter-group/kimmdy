### Task { #kimmdy.tasks.Task }

`tasks.Task(self, f, kwargs={})`

A task to be performed as as a step in the RunManager.

A task consists of a function and its keyword arguments and is
itself callable. The function must return a TaskFiles object.

### TaskFiles { #kimmdy.tasks.TaskFiles }

`tasks.TaskFiles(get_latest, input=field(default_factory=dict), output=field(default_factory=dict), outputdir=Path())`

Input and Output files and directories.

Hosts the input and output files belonging to a task.
A function or method that wants to be callable as a Task
has to return a TaskFiles object.
The input defaultdict is populated on the fly using
get_latest of the runmanager to find newest files.
Files which can not be found by get_latest must be added manually.

#### Examples

```python
>>> class run():
>>>     def get_latest(self, s):
>>>         return f"latest {s}"
>>> runmng = run()
>>> files = TaskFiles(runmng)
>>> files.input
>>> files.input["top"]
{'top': 'latest top'}
```
