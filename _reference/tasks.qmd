# tasks { #kimmdy.tasks }

`tasks`

The tasks module holds the TaskFiles class which organizes input and 
output paths and the Task class for steps in the runmanager.

## Classes

| Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [AutoFillDict](#kimmdy.tasks.AutoFillDict) | Dictionary that gets populated by calling get_missing. |
| [Task](#kimmdy.tasks.Task) | A task to be performed as as a step in the RunManager. |
| [TaskFiles](#kimmdy.tasks.TaskFiles) | Class for Task input and output files and directories. |

### AutoFillDict { #kimmdy.tasks.AutoFillDict }

`tasks.AutoFillDict(self, get_missing)`

Dictionary that gets populated by calling get_missing.

### Task { #kimmdy.tasks.Task }

`tasks.Task(self, runmng, f, kwargs=None, out=None)`

A task to be performed as as a step in the RunManager.

A task consists of a function and its keyword arguments.
Calling a taks calls the stored function.
The function must return a TaskFiles object.



#### Parameters:

runmng
    Runmanager instance from which the task is called
f
    Function that will be called when the task is called
kwargs
    kwargs to be passed to f
out
    If not None, an output dir will be created with this name

### TaskFiles { #kimmdy.tasks.TaskFiles }

`tasks.TaskFiles(get_latest, input=field(default_factory=dict), output=field(default_factory=dict), outputdir=Path(), logger=logging.getLogger('kimmdy.basetask'))`

Class for Task input and output files and directories.

Hosts the input and output file paths belonging to a task.
A function or method that wants to be callable as a Task
has to return a TaskFiles object.
The input defaultdict is populated on the fly using
get_latest of the runmanager to find newest files.
Files which can not be found by get_latest must be added manually.



#### Atributes

get_latest:
    Runmanager.get_latest function that returns paths to the latest file of given type.
input:
    Input file paths for a Task. Is populated by get_latest or manually.
output:
    Output file paths for a Task. Is populated by runmanager._discover_output_files or manually.
outputdir:
    Output directory for a Task. Typically populated by create_task_directory called by Task.
logger:
    Logger for a Task. Initialized in create_task_directory.

#### Examples

```python
>>> class run():
>>>     def get_latest(self, s):
>>>         return f"latest {s}"
>>> runmng = run()
>>> files = TaskFiles(runmng)
>>> files.input
>>> files.input["top"]
{'top': 'latest top'}
```

## Functions

| Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [create_task_directory](#kimmdy.tasks.create_task_directory) | Creates TaskFiles object, output directory, logger and symlinks ff. |

### create_task_directory { #kimmdy.tasks.create_task_directory }

`tasks.create_task_directory(runmng, postfix)`

Creates TaskFiles object, output directory, logger and symlinks ff.

Gets called when a Task is called (from the runmanager.tasks queue).
