## Further Examples

KIMMDY contains examples generated from our internal test systems.
Those examples don't currently have extensive documentation,
but they can be used as a starting point for your own simulations.

The examples are located in the `examples` directory of the KIMMDY source code
[here](https://github.com/hits-mbm-dev/kimmdy/tree/main/example).
